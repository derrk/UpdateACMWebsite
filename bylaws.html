							<h1>Our Local Chapter</h1>
						</header>
						<p>Our desire at the MSU Texas ACM is to create a space for anyone who is interested in using Technology to solve real world problems. We have events in addition to member meetings that are geared toward this goal. As computer scientists, it's easy to sit in our shells and avoid interaction with other people. We want to offer a fun and safe community where even introverts can fit in.</p>
